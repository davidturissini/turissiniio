	<h1>Meet David</h1>
	<p>Welcome to turissini.io. My name is David Turissini, and this is where I post my travels and adventures. I love travelling, hiking and backpacking. I recently got my PADI open water certification and I also occassionally dabble in mountaineering. I take any chance to experience the outdoors and live life to the fullest.</p>

	<h1>Meet Melissa</h1>
	<p>Since Melissa and I met in 2011, we have been flying around the country together experiencing a lot of what this diverse nation has to offer. Melissa is currently a graduate student in Seattle but will be moving down to California in the next few months.</p>
